Please watch the Demo Video.

The demo demonstrates tat the UI implemented is very rudimentary 
but still based on the current Concordia Student Hub UI. We've 
only implemented the necessary pages to demonstrate the flow of 
UX, so many of the pages are left as placeholders for current 
Student Hub pages.

Of note: due to not having access to current Concordia database 
for course selection, many implementation are either hard coded, 
have detailed pop ups, or link to other related pages in order to 
demonstrate functionality.
